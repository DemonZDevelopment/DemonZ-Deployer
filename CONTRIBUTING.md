## Code of Conduct

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs and technical issues are tracked via GitHub Issues. When creating an issue, please include the following diagnostic information:
* A concise summary of the problem.
* Exact steps to reproduce the behavior.
* Your operating system and browser version (e.g., Android 14, Chrome Mobile).
* Any relevant terminal logs or error codes presented in the Deployer UI.

* A detailed description of the proposed functionality or UI change.

### Submitting Pull Requests

DemonZ Development welcomes pull requests for bug fixes, documentation improvements, and verified feature additions. To ensure a streamlined review process, adhere to the following steps:

1. Fork the repository and create your working branch from `main`.
2. Utilize clear, descriptive branch names (e.g., `fix/terminal-scroll` or `feat/dark-mode-toggle`).
3. Ensure your modifications strictly adhere to the existing architectural design (zero-server, client-side only execution).
4. Test your changes locally to ensure no existing functionality is broken.
5. Submit a pull request containing a detailed breakdown of your modifications and the reasoning behind them.

## Development Setup

DemonZ Deployer operates entirely on a static serverless architecture. There are no external backend dependencies, build tools, or local servers required to test the frontend interface.

1. Clone your fork to your local environment.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your preferred web browser.
3. Apply modifications to the HTML, CSS, or JS architecture as required.

## Commit Standards

We utilize conventional commit messaging to maintain a clean and readable repository history. Please prefix your commit messages using the following standards:

* `feat:` (Introduction of a new feature)
* `fix:` (Resolution of a bug or error)
* `docs:` (Modifications to documentation or the README)
* `style:` (Code formatting, interface adjustments, or typographical corrections)
* `refactor:` (Code structure changes that neither fix a bug nor add a direct feature)

Thank you for contributing to DemonZ Development.
